        "\n",
        "This project aimed to build a document-based Question Answering (QA) system using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "####  Approach Summary:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Data Loading**:\n",
        "   - Loaded legal and policy-related text documents from the given corpus using a custom text loader.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Embedding**:\n",
        "   - Used the **`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`** model from `sentence-transformers` to embed the documents into a vector store for semantic search.\n",
        "   - Created a **FAISS index** to enable efficient similarity-based retrieval.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Retriever**:\n",
        "   - Retrieved relevant documents for a given query using cosine similarity search over the embeddings.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Question Answering Model**:\n",
        "   - Used a **pretrained QA-tuned transformer model**: `deepset/roberta-base-squad2`.\n",
        "   - Integrated this with the retriever to answer questions in an extractive QA fashion (selecting answers from retrieved context).\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Evaluation**:\n",
        "   - Extracted benchmark questions and their ground truth answers from provided `.json` files.\n",
        "   - Evaluated the system output using standard NLP metrics: **BLEU**, **ROUGE-1**, and **ROUGE-L**.\n",
        "\n",
        "####  Final Evaluation Scores:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **BLEU Score**: `0.0176`\n",
        "- **ROUGE-1 Score**: `0.1435`\n",
        "- **ROUGE-L Score**: `0.0913`\n",
        "\n",
        "####  Insights:\n",
        "\n",
        "- The combination of semantic search and an extractive QA model worked reasonably well in retrieving and selecting relevant context for legal-style questions.\n",
        "- The use of `deepset/roberta-base-squad2` ensured the answers were span-based, leading to precise but sometimes rigid responses.\n",
        "- The low BLEU score suggests limited overlap in exact wordings with ground truth, which is common for span-based QA over complex documents.\n",
        "- ROUGE scores indicate some degree of lexical overlap, but there is significant scope for improving the relevance and fluency of the generated answers.\n",
        "\n",
        "####  Conclusion:\n",
        "\n",
        "The system demonstrated the effectiveness of using a lightweight yet powerful embedding model (`MiniLM`) and a QA-tuned transformer (`RoBERTa`) to build a legal QA system. The pipeline can be further improved by refining retrieval (e.g., chunking strategy), using generative models for more natural answers, or applying better evaluation metrics for extractive QA.\n"
